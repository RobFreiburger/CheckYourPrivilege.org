# Contributing
There are only a few rules to contribute:
- Your contribution must work on GitHub Pages (I'll probably include a Travis CI check soon)
- If you want to add a new group, include a brief description and a couple resources.
- Do not take this too seriously. Someone isn't going to change just because they visited a humorous but semi-serious website.
